## Pull Requests

Before we can merge your pull request, you need to accept our CLA [here](https://github.com/espocrm/cla).

It's desirable that one PR solves one specific problem. Do not include code style changes to PRs
(unless the main purpose of the PR is code style fixes).

If you would like to contribute something that is not a small fix, it's reasonable to create an issue first
(a bug report or feature request).

Branches:

* *master* – the develop branch; new features should be pushed to here;
* *fix* – the upcoming maintenance release; small fixes should be pushed to here.

## Issues

We'd appreciate if you prefer posting issues on weekdays rather than weekends.

When reporting a possible bug, please provide detail steps so that we will be able
to reproduce the issue. Please try not to use phrases like "very big bug",
"huge issue", etc. No need to use exclamation marks as well.

Note that we don't provide developer help or any kind of support on GitHub.
For this, please use our [forum](https://forum.espocrm.com).
