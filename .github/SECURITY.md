# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in EspoCRM, please contacts us via [this](https://www.espocrm.com/contacts/) or [this](https://www.espocrm.com/support/) forms. Or create a private vulnerability report on GitHub.

### LLM slop

Low-effort, LLM-generated reports are not allowed. In such cases, if it is evident that the author does not understand the subject they submitted, the account will be blocked.

## Supported versions

For severe vulnerabilities we provide fixes for 2 minor versions (the second number in the version string) back from the current stable version.
