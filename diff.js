/**
 * Builds upgrade packages.
 * From a specified version to the current version or all packages needed for a release.

 * Examples:
 * * `node diff 5.9.0` - builds an upgrade from 5.9.0 to the current version;
 * * `node diff --all` - builds all upgrades needed for a release.
 *
 * Data for upgrade packages is defined in `upgrades/{x.x|x.x.x-x.x.x}/data.json`.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * * `mandatoryFiles` – {string[]} – mandatory files to include in upgrade
 *   (even files that were not changed in version control);
 * * `beforeUpgradeFiles` – {string[]} – files to copy in the beginning of the upgrade process;
 * * `manifest` – {object} – upgrade manifest parameters.
 *
 * Manifest parameters:
 * * `delete` – {string[]} – additional files to be deleted (usually those that are not in version control).
